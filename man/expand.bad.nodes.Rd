\title{Expands high degree nodes into many ternary nodes.}
\usage{
expand.bad.nodes(T)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{A tree}
}
\description{
This function takes all inner nodes of degree more than 4
and replaces them with a small binary tree. In the current implementation every high degree node is replaced with a chain.
In this way this step of the procedure is quick and we can attack bigger trees.
